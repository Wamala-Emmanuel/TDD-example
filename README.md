# TDD-example
An elementary demonstration of the test first and test last approach in test driven development and it is typed in NodeJs.
In this example, i have two functions. One to calculate the factorial of a number and the other to calculate the nth element of the fibonacci series.
The modules folder contains two JS files each with a single module(Factorial & Fibonacci).
The test folder contains one JS file which has the code to be used for testing the modules.

## Instructions
Initialize a node project; npm init
Install the dependencies; npm i mocha chai
Add "test": "mocha" within scripts in the package.json file.
Run npm test or npm test --s to hide the npm log messages.

## Dependencies
  "mocha": "^8.0.1"
  "chai": "^4.2.0"
